								to manage challenge and user data) (collectively the “</span></span><span class=None><span lang=DE >Site</span></span><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >”) operated
								by Shareity Inc. in the United States. Your access to and use of the Service
								constitutes acceptance by you or the entity you represent (“User” of “Users”)
								of the following terms and conditions of use (the “Terms of Use”).&nbsp;</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >There are a few definitions we’d like to get out of the way. A
								User is any individual who accesses the Site and uses the Service, regardless
								of whether it is on their own personal behalf or on the behalf of a Brand,
								Cause or Promoter. A User can be an individual challenge participant (“</span></span><span class=None><span lang=FR >Participant</span></span><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >”), an
								individual who contributes (“Sponsors”) a donation to a challenge campaign
								(“Cause”), the organizer of their own Cause or the (“Promoter”), marketing coordinator
								of campaigns. A Cause might more often be an organized not-for-profit,
								individual, charitable fund, governmental organization, or other entity but not
								necessarily so.  A Verified Cause is one that has been verified via 501C3
								status. Likewise, much of the time the Sponsor (“Brand”) of a challenge
								campaign will be a company, corporation, individual, government organization or
								charitable fund that has agreed to Sponsor the donation based on each
								Participant’s completion of the challenge.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not access or
								use the Service.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >The Service and Site are protected by intellectual property laws
								worldwide. Nothing in these Terms of Use shall be deemed to confer any
								third-party rights or benefits on any such content.</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >The Service allows Participants to direct donations by Brands in
								support of selected Causes as displayed in the Service. You acknowledge that
								the Cause that may be listed in the Site has subscribed to the Services on
								their own, and that SHAREITY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING ANY
								PURPOSE, ITS VALIDITY, TAX-EXEMPT STATUS, OR ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT
								THE CAUSE. Only Causes that have subscribed and agreed to the Shareity Service
								may receive donations from a Participant’s use of the Service.</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >&nbsp;</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >A Participant does not have to contribute any funds themselves
								to participate in a challenge campaign, although they certainly may do so
								(becoming a “Sponsor”). We at Shareity have no role in or responsibility for
								the relationship between the Brand/Sponsor and the Cause nor do we guarantee
								fulfillment of the Brand/Sponsor/Promoter’s commitment to deliver the promised
								donations. Each Brand/Sponsor communicates directly with the Cause with respect
								to how and when the donation will be made, directly in our Shareity Dashboard.
								The Services provided under these Terms of Use are subject to payment of fees
								by the Brand to us (“</span></span><span class=None><span lang=NL >Fees</span></span><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >”). The amount of the Fees
								varies with each campaign, depending upon the members subscribed, actions,
								interactions, aggregate donation amount and the number of individual donations.
								The Fees that we charge a Brand are for management of the campaign and use of
								platform. </span></span><span class=None><b><span lang=EN-US >We do not charge the Cause any fees for Brand Sponsored
										Challenges and neither request nor permit any deduction from the donation.</span></b></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >Challenges are voluntary and elected. Shareity is not endorsing
								the use of the platform and or challenges for any other purpose other than
								raising money and/or awareness. Further Shareity does not protect or defend the
								integrity of any particular challenge, its purpose or outcome. Shareity does
								not recommend or take responsibility for any challenge ideas or their effects
								on society/users/causes/brands. Challenges should always be done with caution
								and awareness of surroundings, with regard to personal and public safety,
								property and human rights. Shareity is not liable for any damages or negative
								results from improper use of the platform by Users, Causes, Brands or
								Promoters, in connection with challenges or other promotional means. Always use
								caution when planning, implementing or participating in a challenge.</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >By agreeing to these Terms of Use, each Brand commits to paying
								the Fees to Shareity directly via payment processor, credit card, bank transfer
								or certified check in the form of (“Credits”) at the beginning of every
								campaign. One Credit is required for every participant added to the database
								(participating in the challenge). Credits must be bought before a campaign can
								become active in the database and Site. Credits must be for the full amount of
								the campaign for total anticipated Users. For example: Brand wants to donate
								$10,000 at $1 per user – they must purchase 10,000 Credits (total number or
								participants in the challenge). The price of credits may change based on demand
								and services provided. Credits can also be used to send out messages and
								rewards to users, buy Keywords, or start new campaigns. If Credits are not
								fully used in the intended campaign (campaign has ended or not reach a certain
								goal), they can be used in future campaigns, promotions, or outreach as they
								never expire.</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >Participants may also receive benefits from a Brand, Cause,
								Promotor, or Shareity for completing a challenge (ie: rewards, messages, status
								ratings, SWAG). These rewards can be promotional material but cannot constitute
								SPAM. Shareity, a Brand, Cause, or Promoter may also conduct contests and/or
								sweepstakes through the Site, abiding by local governing laws and regulations.</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >We expect that each participating Brand/Sponsor/Promoter will
								take every reasonable care to ensure that all donations and related
								transactions are conducted via a secure connection. However, the security of
								information and payments transmitted via the internet (outside of Shareity
								platform) cannot be guaranteed. The Participant and Cause each acknowledges and
								agrees that: (i) donations are at a Brand’s own discretion; and (ii) Shareity
								has no liability whatsoever for (a) any loss the Participant, Brand, or Cause
								may suffer if a Brand fails to fulfill its donation commitment or (b) if a
								third party obtains unauthorized access to any information provided by the
								User. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >By accepting these Terms of Use, each Brand/Sponsor commits and
								promises to deliver to the donation it has offered for each challenge campaign
								Cause. The donation commitment is described in each challenge campaign and set
								between the Brand and Cause during campaign Set Up. For example, a Brand may
								commit to deliver $1 for each Participant who completes a challenge or a Brand
								may commit to deliver a certain amount of goods or services to the Cause if a
								certain number of challenges are completed. The Brand must convey its donation
								in a reasonable time following completion or end of the challenge campaign.
								Shareity may block a Brand from participating in future challenge campaigns if
								there is reason to believe that a Brand has not fully delivered on its donation
								commitment. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >Each Brand and Cause licenses to Shareity any trademarks, trade
								names, logos and any other content it uploads to the Site for the challenge
								campaign (“Campaign Content”). Each Brand and Cause represents and warrants
								that it has all requisite rights to upload such content and shall indemnify
								Shareity for any expenses or losses arising from a third party’s claim that
								Campaign Content infringes its intellectual property rights. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >Each Brand, Cause, or Promoter is responsible for using the
								Shareity Site and the Services in compliance with all applicable laws. Shareity
								is not responsible for identifying, assessing, or informing Users of which laws
								may apply in their use of the Site and the Service. Each Brand and Cause shall
								indemnify Shareity for any expenses or losses arising from use of the Service
								in violation of the laws of a particular jurisdiction.</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >Each Brand and Cause commits to participating in each challenge
								campaign for the duration of the campaign as specified in the campaign Set Up.</span></span></p>

		<p class=Default><span class=None><span lang=EN-US >Our collection, retention and use of personal information
