          href="https://shareity.com" target="_blank" style="color: blue;" rel="noopener noreferrer"> shareity.me</a>

          rel="noopener noreferrer">app.shareity.me</a> (<a href="https://my.shareity.com" target="_blank"
          style="color: blue;" rel="noopener noreferrer">my.shareity.com</a>) (to participate in a challenge) or <a
          href="https://members.shareity.me" target="_blank" style="color: blue;"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">members.shareity.me</a> (<a href="https://business.shareity.com" target="_blank"
          style="color: blue;" rel="noopener noreferrer">business.shareity.com</a>)(Dashboard to manage challenge and
        user data) (collectively the “Site”) operated by Shareity Inc. in the United States. We at  Shareity  respect
        your privacy. This Privacy Notice describes the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it,
        and how we use it. We primarily collect user information in an effort to improve your experience and communicate
        with you about Causes and challenges, which we explain in more detail below. This Privacy Notice describes the
        choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. We do not sell or rent your personal
        information to third parties. This Notice does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or
        control, or to people whom we do not employ or manage.   </p>
      <p>With respect to the collection of your information, if you do not want your personal information collected,
        please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted information and would like to review, correct, or
        remove it from our records, please log in to your account or contact us via steve@shareity.com   </p>
      <p>By visiting and using the Site, you are deemed to have agreed to the provisions of this Privacy Notice, unless
        you are in the EEA or Switzerland in which case you are acknowledging that you have been provided this Privacy
        Notice.   <a href="https://shareity.com/terms-of-use.php" target="_blank" style="color: blue;"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Use  </a></p>
      <p>There are a few definitions we’d like to get out of the way (and repeat from the Terms of Use) so that you
        understand the way in which this Privacy Notice applies to you. A User is any individual who accesses the Site
        and uses the Service, regardless of whether it is on their own personal behalf or on the behalf of a Brand,
        Cause or Promoter. A User can be an individual challenge participant (“Participant”), an individual who
        contributes (“Sponsors”) a donation to a challenge campaign (“Cause”),the organizer of their own Cause or the
        (“Promoter”), marketing coordinator of campaigns. A Cause might more often be an organized not-for-profit,
        individual, charitable fund, governmental organization, or other entity but not necessarily so. Likewise, much
        of the time the Sponsor (“Brand”) of a challenge campaign will be a company, corporation, individual, government
        organization or charitable fund that has agreed to Sponsor the donation based on each Participant’s completion
        of the challenge.</p>
      <p><b>2. What Data Do We Collect? </b></p>
      <p>We don’t receive any identifiable personal data about you other than what you provide us, either by creating an
        account, using the Services, from Facebook when you agree to connect your Facebook account to Shareity, or data
        we can infer from your use of the Services. </p>
      <p>When you create a Shareity account: We will collect basic contact information about you to set up your account
        so you can manage a Brand’s donations, develop a challenge page for a Cause, or participate in a challenge. This
        may include your name, phone number, address and email address. For Shareity Database users we will also ask you
        to register a username and password so you can gain secure access to your account in the future.   </p>
      <p>When you sign in to Shareity using your Facebook account: If you choose to login via Facebook, we will obtain
        access to your Facebook public profile information and email address. We will use this information to allow you
        to login and populate our records about you. If you give us permission (via Facebook’s preference settings), we
        may also obtain access to your friend list but we only receive the names of your friends who are
        also Shareity users. We will only use this to see if people on your friends list are also using our website and
        as set out in How we use personal information below. You can control whether or not Facebook shares this data
        with us, either by changing your preferences when you first login to Shareity with your Facebook account or by
        visiting the app setting controls on Facebook’s platform.   </p>
      <p>When you complete a challenge: To enable us to process evidence of your Sponsoring a Cause through completion
        of a challenge, we will collect basic information associated with your challenge completion, such as phone
        number, email address or location (if elected for specific challenges). Your Picture/Video/Gaming/AR content of
        the challenge (“Challenge Content”) you completed will display on your social media account, text and email (if
        you choose to share). Challenge Content may also be used in Shareity for managing campaigns and promotional
        material. As a general practice we ask Brand/Cause/Promoters to ask individuals about the use of their Challenge
        Content prior to using it in future promotions and campaigns. This can be done via Shareity messaging
        in Shareity Dashboard. As with any platform when you share or post online it can be viewed or used by third
        parties via screenshot, so be mindful of this.   </p>
      <p>When you create a Shareity Challenge: We will use the details you provided when you set up your account to
        create your Shareity Challenge or challenge page. We will also collect details of the Cause or not-for-profit
        that you are supporting, or the details for your proposed challenge page. Where applicable, we will ask you to
        provide details of how and when you are intending to Sponsor and/or the occasion you are recognizing by carrying
        out the challenge.   </p>
      <p>When you give us information about others: You may decide to provide us with information about others (or
        authorize us to collect this information on your behalf from your social networks or your contacts list) for
        example:  </p>
      <p>so we can help you tell your friends and family about a Cause you are running or challenge you are carrying
        out; or  if you start a Cause or a challenge for, or in the memory or in celebration of, another person  </p>
      <p>You must ensure that they have agreed to you providing us with their information. Where required by local laws,
        we would advise you to keep a record of their agreement and provide them with a copy of, or link to, this
        Notice. This is especially the case if you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. a reference to
        an illness or health condition).   </p>
      <p>You should also only contact individuals using the Services who you know would be happy to hear from you and
        must not use our Services to send unsolicited ‘SPAM’ messages. This is strictly enforced and users have the
        right to opt out of your campaign.   </p>
      <p>If you create a Cause for a club, organization, body or association that is managed by someone other than
        yourself, you must ensure that the manager(s) of that club, organization etc. agrees to your fundraising (e.g.
        you are a member of a sports club and want to raise funds for a new clubhouse – you must seek the agreement of
        the sports club committee).   </p>
      <p>When you use the Services: We also collect information about your use of our Services, including your URLs, IP
        address, mobile device identifier, how much time you spend on the Site, and what you do, like or view. We do
        this through the use of cookies. Our Site automatically logs indirect personal data from visitors. We consider
        indirect personal data to be data that does not clearly identify you but under some circumstances could. This
        sort of anonymous and indirect information include: URLs, IP addresses, operating system or platform
        identification information, browser identification information, information about the Internet website(s) from
        which a visitor may have linked to our Site, visitor activity on the Site, and the dates and times of Site
        visits and purchases. We collect and retain this type of information through the use of cookies and other
        technologies, to assist us in operating and improving the Site. We treat information collected by cookies and
        other technologies as non-identifying information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
        or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal
        data. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal or indirect information is combined with personal data, we
        treat the combined information as personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Notice. </p>
      <p>Shareity and our partners (e.g. marketing partners) use a variety of technologies such as cookies, URL beacons,
        tags and scripts, to track Site performance, to make your visit better, and for aggregate Site/Challenge
        analytics. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking Users’ movements
        around the Site and to gather demographic information about our User base as a whole. We may receive reports
        based on the use of these technologies from our service providers or partners on an individual as well as
        aggregated basis. For example, the Site uses Google Analytics to measure web page views, performance, and such.
        To learn about how Google Analytics uses your information, visit the site “How Google uses Data when you use our
        partner’s sites or apps.”  </p>
      <p>Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web
        applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to
        track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  </p>
      <p><b>3. What Happens If You Don’t Want Us to Have Your Data? </b></p>
      <p>You are not required to provide personal data to us. Note, however, that your failure to do so may affect our
        ability to provide the Services you request (if you are a Brand, Cause or Promotor) and if you are a Participant
        your completion of a challenge necessarily involves the sharing of some personal data to authenticate challenge
        and facilitate donations. If, at any time, you are unsatisfied with Shareity or any parties using your data you
        may delete your account in Profile Settings. Once account is deleted all data, impact and money raised (if it
        hasn’t already been donated) will be erased.  </p>
      <p><b>4. How Do We Use Your Data? </b></p>
      <p>Shareity uses your personal data to provide the Services you request, to personalize your Shareity experience,
        to send you communications and to enhance your ability to raise funds for the Causes you care about and to track
        your particular impact for a Cause (challenge campaign).   </p>

        help us understand data when you use our Services, described in the How Do We Use Data? Section.. </li>
      <p></p>
      <p>We also may share your personal data with<br>
        Causes and Brands as follows: </p>
      <p><b>Causes:</b> We share information, via Shareity Dashboard, details about donations made to them, including
        name and data associated with Participant Challenge Content and evidence of challenges completion. Causes who
        are registered with Shareity also have access to data about Sponsors so the Cause can understand who is
        fundraising for their benefit, Shareity ID for each user known to be linked to a specific phone number, and
        challenge analytics on sharing impact.  </p>
      <p><b>Brands/Promoters: </b>We share data, via Shareity Dashboard, with a Brand that Sponsors each Participant’s
        challenge so they can understand the demographics of who is completing challenges for their Causes and what
        donations must be relayed to the Cause.   </p>
      <p>The data we share with Brands/Promoters includes the Cause’s name, the name and creation date of the challenge,
        the fundraising target, how much Participants’ have raised and the number of total challenges, challenge
        analytics on sharing an impact, Challenge Content and a Shareity ID known to be linked to a specific phone
        number.   </p>
      <p>The data we share with Brands/Promoters includes the Cause’s name, the name and creation date of the challenge,
        the fundraising target, how much Participants’ have raised and the number of total challenges, challenge
        analytics on sharing an impact, Challenge Content and a Shareity ID known to be linked to a specific phone
        number. </p>
      <p><b>6. How Do Causes/Brands/Promoters Use My Data? </b></p>
      <p>As stated above, unless you elect to be anonymous to which you Sponsor a donation or on whose behalf you
        complete a challenge, we will share evidence of your participation and Challenge Content. When we pass this
        personal data along via Shareity Dashboard, subscribed Causes/Brands/Promoters also become controllers with
        respect to such personal data. This means that they’re responsible for their own compliance with applicable
        privacy and data protection laws when they use your personal data, and all such use is subject to the Cause’s
        own privacy notice. In certain jurisdictions such as the EU, when Causes receive your details, they are required
        to send you their privacy notice. Shareity is not responsible for participating organization’s use of your
        personal data or the participating organization’s compliance with applicable laws.   </p>
      <p>When you Sponsor a Cause by participating in a challenge you could be asked whether or not you consent to
        receiving email from the participating organization about the impact of your donation and other ways to support
        them including future events, campaigns and appeals. If you opt in to receiving such emails, we will pass your
        consent preference on to that organization, if it is subscribed to receive such reporting from us. Note that the
        organizations will need to receive your personal data to send you emails you consent to receive.   </p>
      <p>If you want to change your preferences for an organization to use your data (to contact you or otherwise),
        please contact the organization directly.  </p>
      <p>If the organization you’re interacting with hasn’t subscribed to receive organization reporting from Shareity,
        that organization won’t have access to details about your consent preferences. This means that they won’t know
        if you have opted in or out of receiving email fundraising appeals.   </p>
      <p>Note that participating organizations receive information about supporters from lots of different sources.
        We’re not the system of record for our organization partners. We cannot reflect any changes in your consent
        preferences that you make directly with the organization. For example, if you opt in to receive emails from an
        organization when you Sponsor a donation through Shareity, but then you subsequently opt out by telling the
        organization, Shareity won’t have a record that you opted out of receiving email from that organization.  </p>
      <p><b>7. How Do We Use Personal Data of Our Brand, Cause or Promoter Users? </b></p>
      <p>If you work for a Cause, Brand or Promoter, we use your data in slightly different ways than for Participant
        users of the Services.   </p>
      <p>We collect an organization (Cause, Brand, Promoter) user’s name, work email address, and office number. We use
        this data to enable you to sign into your account and to access the shareity.me (shareity.com) platform for
        reporting. In addition, we may use your data to perform business services you request. Finally, we will send you
        the following email communications: operational emails, customer service emails and business marketing emails.
        When you log into your account, you can opt out of receiving emails from us, other than service emails related
        to your requests.  </p>
      <p>The following sections 8-11 are specific to Users in the EU.  </p>
      <p><b>8. What Are Your EU Rights? </b></p>
      <p>Shareity recognizes that your personal data belongs to you and we don’t wish to use it in ways that you don’t
        want us to.   </p>
      <p>You can control whether or not you receive marketing email from Shareity by visiting your Account.   </p>
      <p>You can also exercise a variety of rights regarding our use of your data:   </p>
      <li style="font-family: Roboto,sans-serif !important;font-size: 15px;">You can ask us for a copy of the
        information we have about you </li>
      <p></p>
      <li style="font-family: Roboto,sans-serif !important;font-size: 15px;">You can ask us to correct any incorrect
        data we have about you and you can also update your account details yourself at any time by visiting
        your Shareity account   </li>
      <p></p>
      <li style="font-family: Roboto,sans-serif !important;font-size: 15px;">You can ask us to delete your data, or do
        it yourself  </li>
      <p></p>
      <li style="font-family: Roboto,sans-serif !important;font-size: 15px;">You can ask for your data in a common,
        machine-readable format  </li>
      <p></p>
      <li style="font-family: Roboto,sans-serif !important;font-size: 15px;">You can object to any processing we do on
        the basis of legitimate interests or to any automated decision-making  </li>
      <p></p>
      <li style="font-family: Roboto,sans-serif !important;font-size: 15px;">You can ask us to restrict the processing
        of your data  </li>
      <p></p>
      <p>To exercise any of the foregoing rights, please contact us with your request. Note that some of these rights
        aren’t absolute—for example, we may not be able to delete all your personal data if we have to keep some of your
        data to comply with the law—but we’ll evaluate your request in accordance with applicable privacy and data
        protection laws. Shareity will respond to your request within one month of receiving it. Also, note that you
        have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in your country of residence
        or place of work.  </p>
      <p><b>9. On What Legal Bases Do We Process Your EU Data? </b></p>
      <p>We process your personal data on a variety of legal bases depending on the use. For example, we will only
        process your personal data to send you direct marketing if we have your consent and you can withdraw this
        consent at any time opting out of receiving such emails. Sometimes it is necessary to process your data for us
        to comply with our legal obligations. Typically, though, we are processing your personal data in order to
        fulfill your request concerning our Services, management of a challenge, or coordinating with a sponsoring
        Brand.  </p>
      <p><b>10. How Are We Using Your EU Data Based on Our Legitimate Interests? </b></p>
      <p>We may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests, provided that these uses aren’t
        outweighed by your rights or interests. For any uses we justify on the basis of legitimate interest, you have
        the right to opt out of such processing by contacting us, or doing so yourself.  </p>
      <p><b>11. Are We Doing Any Automated Decision Making on EU Data? </b></p>
      <p>To help our Causes fundraise more effectively, we may employ machine learning and other analytics that make
        inferences about some characteristics of our Participants. We use these tools to tailor messages to you, to show
        and prioritize Causes we think you’ll be interested in, and make suggestions about how much you may want to
        participate in a challenge or donate. You can opt out of these processes at any time by contacting us.  </p>
      <p><b>12. Where Are We Processing Your Data? </b></p>
      <p>We store and process all personal data relating to challenges and Users within the US.   </p>
      <p>If you are visiting our Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information will
        typically be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our
        central database is operated. The privacy and data protection and other laws of the United States and other
        countries might not be the same as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable
        steps to ensure that your personal data is protected. By using our Services, you understand that your
        information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in
        this Privacy Notice.  </p>
      <p><b>13. How Long Do We Keep Your Data? </b></p>
      <p>We keep your personal data in an identifiable form for as long as we have a legitimate reason to use the data
        and as required by law.  </p>
      <p><b>14. How Do We Notify You of Changes to this Notice? </b></p>
      <p>We keep this Notice under regular review and place updates on the Site. We will also provide notifications of
        material changes via email or other channels. If you keep using the Services after we notify you, you consent to
        the updated Privacy Notice. If not, you may contact us.  </p>
